<p>This blog will discuss music, climate, weather, climate and weather in
music, and climate and weather in other media (mediums?). Most of all,
it will be an outlet for me to share music that I love.</p>
<section id="intro">
<h2>Intro<a class="headerlink" href="#intro" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am a climate scientist that specializes in tropical atmospheric
dynamics, especially monsoon circulations. I am also pretty obsesed with
music, though not in any professional capacity. And I am interested in
the connections among science (of weather and climate mostly), music,
and other media (mediums?).</p>
<p>Because being a scientist is my job, I already spend a lot of time each
week thinking about science for its own sake. I get to think about music
etc. much less. So this blog is an attempt to scratch the itch I have to
think and share more about music. The connections made with climate and
weather will (I hope) make it pretty unique.</p>
<p>I have been doing something similar on Twitter for a while now via my
<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CliSciHiFi">#CliSciHiFi</a> series of
tweets. Those have been a blast (despite not exactly having gone viral),
but sometimes there is simply more to say than can fit in a tweet or
thread thereof. I intend to keep up my quasi-weekly pace of
<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CliSciHiFi">#CliSciHiFi</a> tweets and do
these longer blog posts more infrequently.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://smile.amazon.com/Couldnt-Weather-Legacy-Vaughan-Trouble/dp/B003MX5OOY/">Couldn’t Stand The
Weather</a>
is an album by Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, their second,
released in 1984. “Couldn’t Stand The Weather” is also the second track
thereof (after the opener <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/IUsvRaRk9Fs">“Scuttle
Buttin’”</a>, a personal SRV favorite). It
captures a couple things I’m trying to accomplish here. First,
obviously, is linking weather/climate and music. Second, less obviously,
is fun. The song is funky, driving, a tune you can’t help but nod your
head to. It’s also bluesy, with a hell of a lot of soul. I hope this
blog ends up the same way: fun but with substance.</p>
<p>If you’re really feeling the SRV vibes, check out the song’s official
<a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/nO23B5C_Mcw">music video</a>. It’s good on a surface
level for some laughs at the 1980s production cheese. On a deeper level,
sure the symbolic montage of people yelling at each other is
heavy-handed, but it actually also connects with another of my aims:
tuning out the shouting matches to just groove. A lot of climate science
media coverage and in the blogosphere is much closer to the shouting
folks in the video than any of us would probably care to admit. Here,
we’re trying to be Stevie and the fellas jamming instead.  In other words, I couldn’t stand the weather, and this is the result.</p>
<p>Anyways, SRV is rightly known for his virtuosity as a blues guitarist,
but I think he is underrated (especially on the coasts) as a songwriter
and lyricist. Just check out the
<a class="reference external" href="https://genius.com/Stevie-ray-vaughan-couldnt-stand-the-weather-lyrics">lyrics</a>
to this track; the second verse especially is as close to Bob Dylan as
SRV’s guitar licks are to Jimi Hendrix (which is to say, very close)::</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Runnin’ through this business of life
Raisin’ sand if I’m needed to
Ain’t so funny when things ain’t feelin’ right
Then daddy’s hand helps to see me through
Sweet as sugar, love won’t wash away
Rain or shine, it’s always here to stay
All these years you and I’ve spent together
All this we just, couldn’t stand the weather

Like a train that stops at every station
We all deal with trials and tribulations
Fear hangs the fellow that ties up his years
Entangled in yellow and cries all his tears
Changes come before we can grow
Learn to see them before we’re too old
Don’t just take me for tryin’ to be heavy
Understand, it’s time to get ready for the storm
